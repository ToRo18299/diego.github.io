I see software development as the intersection of logic, creativity, and purpose.  
What motivates me is building solutions that not only work but also make sense — intuitive, accessible, and meaningful.  

My background in Electronic Engineering shaped my analytical mindset and curiosity about how systems work.  
Through software development, I found the freedom to design, create, and solve problems that connect technology with people.  
I’m always learning, collaborating, and crafting software that balances functionality, design, and real impact.
